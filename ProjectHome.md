Exodus strives to be a solid, user-friendly, feature-complete Jabber/XMPP client for Windows.

The Exodus client was originally developed by Peter Millard, a longtime contributor to the Jabber/XMPP community. Peter started working on Exodus as a replacement for Winjab (one of the very early Jabber clients), and the Exodus codebase reflected everything he knew about Jabber technologies and specifically the challenges involved in building a modular, robust client for Windows.

Unfortunately, Peter did not live to complete his work on Exodus: he died of complications from cancer on April 26, 2006. Since then, a team of Peter's colleagues from Jabber Inc. have taken up the task of working on Exodus, with the goal of continued improvement to Exodus and ongoing releases to the open-source community.
